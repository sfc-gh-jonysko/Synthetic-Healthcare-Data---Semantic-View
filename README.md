# Synthetic-Healthcare-Data---Semantic-View
Data materialization script and semantic view YAML file for the Synthetic Healthcare Data available on the Snowflake Marketplace.

This is for the following data product on the Snowflake Marketplace - https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZSTZL7M0Q6/snowflake-virtual-hands-on-labs-synthetic-healthcare-data-clinical-and-claims

There are two files here:

1. Script to materialize the shared data product into your own account.  I did this just in case the data product changes in the future, I wouldn't want it to unexpectedly break the semantic view being created.
2. YAML file for Semantic View creation.
