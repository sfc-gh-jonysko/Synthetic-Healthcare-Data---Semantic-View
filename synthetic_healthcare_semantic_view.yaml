custom_instructions: 1. When generating SQL that asks for a date part of a time dimension, do not include the underlying date or datetime field in the SELECT clause used to derive the date part.  For example, if the user asks for 'Year' and the SQL generates a data part function like 'YEAR(TIME_DIMENSION)', only include the 'Year' and not the 'Time_Dimension' in the generated SQL. 2. When returning a number that is the result of an aggregate function (e.g. SUM or COUNT), use a comma to separate thousands in the output.
